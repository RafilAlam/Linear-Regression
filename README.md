# üìà Linear Regression with PyTorch  
üß† **Predicting Continuous Values with Neural Networks**  
> A foundational machine learning model built using **PyTorch**, implementing and training a simple linear regression model `f(x) = w * x + b`. This project demonstrates the use of custom model classes, forward propagation, loss computation, and weight updates with stochastic gradient descent ‚Äî all key components of supervised learning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features  
- Custom `nn.Module` class for defining the model  
- Uses `torch.nn.Linear` for parameterized linear layers  
- MSE loss for regression evaluation  
- SGD optimizer for parameter updates  
- Prints intermediate weights and loss during training  
- Trains on a small handcrafted dataset

## üì¶ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **PyTorch** (`torch`, `torch.nn`)  
- Fully CPU-compatible (no CUDA/GPU required)
